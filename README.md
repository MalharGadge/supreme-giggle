## Introduction
This is a Python-based image retrieval model that utilizes various machine learning techniques. It employs CNN for feature extraction and then uses various ML techniques to varied results. The dataset used here is the CIFAR-10 dataset. You can check out the dataset [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Features
- This model can be used via GUI as well as the command line.
- Image retrieval can be done by:
  - An image whose semantically similar images you want to retrieve.

**Note:** The model performs well when text and images are semantically similar to the images in the dataset.
